# Mini-Beartracks 

A simplified version of the University of Albertaâ€™s BearTracks registration system. This program reads in information about students and courses and uses that information to allow students to enroll into new courses or drop existing courses. Allowed a hands-on experience with file input/output, dictionaries, and string manipulation.
